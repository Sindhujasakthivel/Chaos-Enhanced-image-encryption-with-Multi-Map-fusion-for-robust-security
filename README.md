Overview
This project introduces a powerful image encryption system that harnesses the principles of chaotic maps and multi-map fusion to boost security. By combining different chaotic maps, we enhance the encryption process, making it much harder for unauthorized users to gain access.

Features
Increased Security: Employs chaos theory to create unpredictable encryption patterns.
Multi-Map Fusion: Merges various chaotic maps to add an extra layer of complexity.
High Efficiency: Delivers fast encryption and decryption, making it ideal for real-time applications.
User-Friendly Design: Offers an intuitive interface for easy image encryption.
